Here is the python notebook we used for the acceptance/rejection and VEGAS algorithms for the Drell-Yan Event Generator.

The code has two main sections: the first block defines the functions, the 2nd block runs them with selected parameters.

Default settings are 100,000 samples for acceptance/rejection and 10 iterations of 10,000 samples for VEGAS
